Push it to the Limit
Walk along the razor's edge
but don't look down, just keep your head
and you'll be finished

Open up the limit
Past the point of no return
You've reached the top but still you gotta learn
How to keep it

Hit the wheel and double mistakes
Throttle wide open like a bat out of hell
And you crash the gates
(Crash the gates)

Going for the back of beyond
Nothing gonna stop you
there's nothing that strong.
So close now you're nearly at the brink
So, push it

(Ooo yeah)

Welcome to the limit
(The limit)
Take it maybe one step more
The power game's still playing so
you better win it

(Solo)

Push it to the limit
(The limit)
With no one left to stand in your way
you might get careless, but you'll never be safe
while you still feel it

Welcome to the limit
(The limit)
Standing on the razor's edge
don't look down just keep your head
and you'll be finished

Welcome to the limit
(The limit)
(The limit)
(The limit)
(The limit)

Push it to the limit
(The limit)
(The limit)
(The limit)
(The limit)

(The limit)
(The limit)
(The limit)
(The limit)

Push it to the limit
(The limit)
(The limit)
(The limit)
(The limit)

(The limit)
(The limit)
(The limit)
(The limit)

Push it to the limit
Push it to the limit
